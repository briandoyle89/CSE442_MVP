Once user selects the course and clicks the search button, all the files associated with that course will be populated on the screen, and then the user can download any of the files that he/she wants.  
<br><br>
Testing Procedures-<br>

  1. Uploading a File, can search it to confirm it has been uploaded.<br>

Target-The target is to test the process of uploading a file to our site, UB_Liberator, from the user’s computer.
<br><br>
Testing  Procedure- A user must log in/register at our UB_Liberator landing page. 
After this, the user is taken to the Dashboard page, where there is a blue-colored button called --”Upload a DOCUMENT” located below the “My Uploads” button at the 4th position on the left navigation bar of the page. 
On clicking it, the user is told to enter the file_name, and is asked to select the course for which they are uploading the file. 
Then there is a button called “Choose file” which allows the user to select the file to be uploaded  from their local system. 
Next is the “Upload” button which the user clicks to upload their file to the website. After filling in the file_name, course, and have chosen the file to be uploaded, the “Upload” button must be clicked.
<br><br>
Expected Outcome-After following the testing procedure step by step, the file should show up in the “My Uploads” section (located at the 2nd position of the navigation bar positioned on left-most side of the page). “My Uploads” is a button above the “Upload a DOCUMENT” button, and by clicking it, a user can see the files they have uploaded to the website. Hence, verifying that the Upload functionality actually works. The user can also double check by clicking back to the dashboard, selecting the class they chose for the file, and scrolling down the page until they can view their file in that way.
<br><br>

 2. Registering 
<br><br>
Target-In order to enable the user story, the user has to register and make an account on our website. The target is to test the procedure for registering on to our UB_Liberator site, using their login credentials viz. Email id, username and password which the user can choose.
<br><br>	
Testing Procedure - On the Login page click on the “Don’t Have an Account? Click Here” button to create an account. On doing so, the user will be directed to another login page which will have the following input boxes labelled -  Email, Username and Password. 
In the email box input any email of your choosing It doesn’t specifically have to be your UB mail address). 
Then click on the “Password” and the “Username” box and input any username and password of your choosing. 
After inputting all three click the “Submit” button. 
Once the information is submitted you will be redirected back to the Login page. On the login page input the same username and password that you used for registering and click “Submit”. 
You have now created an account and logged in successfully.
<br><br>	
Expected Outcome- After the student clicks “Submit”, the account should be fully created, and then when the page goes back to the login page, you should be able to fill out the username and password boxes by clicking on them and typing in your appropriate credentials. Then, clicking “Submit” should log you in and direct you to the main Dashboard page.
