Project Description for MVP:
We’re building a file sharing website where students/users can share study materials i.e. previous semesters’ homework, exams, study lessons, lecture notes, study guides and other learning resources. 

Project Structure:
Minimum requirements for A grade(as in we’ll definitely get the file sharing functionality by the end of the semester & might add other features later on) 
File sharing site
Learning resource submissions--in the form of a pdf, docx, png or  other file formats.
User accounts
Submissions tied to account
Search options

Technical Description:-
We’ll be building the project in python, and using Django framework to integrate the front-end & back-end. For front-end we’ll be using Bootstrap. We have yet to decide what we’ll be using for our database, although most probably it’s going to be in SQLite.

Currently Viewing Our Progress:-
As we will be developing a webapp, the first stages involved creating placeholder html files that we will be working on and adding to before we can fully incorporate it. Therefor, to check our current progress, the html files must be opened in browser for viewing at this moment.

Additional Features:-
We might add these later on during the semester:-
Instructors can upload quizzes in the form of a pdf, docx etc.
We’ll be making the user/student accounts anonymous so as to encourage more students to interact with each other.
	Anonymous uploads
Owners can view submission identities
Other users cannot see each others’ identities
Justification: Some school districts don’t allow teachers to submit lessons developed within the district

Rating system for documents
Star system
Based on:
User comments
A way to support another user’s comments as being truthful/useful

User Story:

As a first semester UB CSE student, I need another resource for studying materials similar to what I need to complete, with the ability to upload and download from a site, along with keeping track of items I have downloaded and uploaded in the past. If I happen to violate any academic integrity rule or academic code of honor, it is solely on my own efforts and responsibility.

I sign up/login into the website, and I see a variety of classes available with resources.
I click on a class, and I am presented with a variety of learning materials, from past
study guides to past exams.  I can determine the quality of the help by a group voting
system.  Via the dashboard, I have the option to upload material of my own.  I have a ratio
of work submitted to work downloaded, which I need to keep at a certain level to continue
downloading resources. This ensures that I help foster an environment of learning
by both learning from others and teaching.


Conflict Resolution:

In the event of a conflict, the conflicting teammates will have another teammate flip a coin.  If there is not another teammate present, we will contact someone to flip it via skype, snapchat or something similar.
